# POR_dinoRNAV_MVP

This repository contains the code associated with analyses of the dinoRNAV and Symbiodiniaceae community composition of Porites lobata coral holobionts in Moorea, French Polynesia. Analyses are associated with the manucript "Viruses of a key coral symbiont exhibit temperature-driven productivity across a reefscape."

#Symiodiniaceae LSU data:

LSU amplicon sequencing of Porites DNA was used to identify the Symbiodiniaceae present in each colony. Sequences were processed through the DADA2 pipeline (Callahan et al 2016) and then ASVs were collapsed using the LULU pipeline (Frøslev et al., 2017). Files and code associated with the LULU ASV curation are uploaded here.
